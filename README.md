# AdvancedAlgorithmsAndDataStructures

I'm studying from Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures by Marcello La Rocca.
In this repositories there will be all my implementations of the algorithms and data structures that i find interesting.

The book is really beautiful but it requires some knowledge on basic algorithms and data structures.
I recommend "Introduction to algorithms" by MIT as prior knowledge.
